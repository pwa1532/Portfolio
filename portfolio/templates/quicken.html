				The client
			</div>
			<div>
				Quicken Loans is the #1 online mortgage lend in America. Part of that is their newly launch mobile-optimized site. My team was tasked with performing a comprehensive overview of this site to maximize its useful to its users. This process involved a series of usability evaluations and interpretation session which finally resulted in a set of recommendation for the site.

				Interaction Map
			</div>
			<div>
				Our team started by creating a sitemap of the Quicken Loans mobile site. This showed all the various screen on the site along with how they were connected. This familiarized us with all the various components and features of the site; additionally giving us a common nomenclature for the site. The center of the map houses the "Home" page of the site which is surrounded by all the different pages. Each section of the map is outlined in a different color which corresponds to one button on the "Home" page. A printed version along with digital versions aided the team in the rest of the evaluation process.

				Interviews, Personas and Scenarios
			</div>
			<div>
				The next step in the evaluation was to get an idea of who the intended use of the site was and what they wanted out of this. This was accomplished by talking with Quicken Loans to access the demographic data they monitored of their average user. The team used this data to find a set of six typical users in the Ann Arbor area they could meet with and interview. The interview asked the users a series of demographic, personality, mobile technology usage and mortgage related questions in order to better understand the target audience. After each interview the team would meet to debrief on their findings. After all the interviews were complete a series of meetings were held in order to create a set of personas and scenarios that the team felt were representative of both the data Quicken Loans and given us and the interviews we conducted. This resulted in a set of three personas, each with a unique set of credit scores, technology familiarity and experience goals. These personas were constantly consulted throughout the rest of the evaluation process as the target uses of the system.

				Comparative Evaluation
			</div>
			<div>
				A comparative analysis of the site was performed, comparing the Quicken Loans mobile site to the mobile sites of various other banks, mortgage brokers, mortgage rate calculators and generally well designed mobile sites. A series of criteria were created under the categories of usability and presentation, mortgage and financial information, application for loan, and mortgage calculator. Each site was rated on a zero to four or not applicable. These were then illustrated on a poster and given to Quicken Loans in a report.

				Heuristic Evaluation
			</div>
			<div>
				A heuristic evaluation was performed of the site by the members of the team, critiquing the site on heuristics such as design and navigation. Nielson's ten heuristics we consulted and used as a springboard to create a set of custom heuristics the team believed to be important to the site. Each team member then performed a evaluation of each section of the site, ranking each problem found as either low, medium, or high. The team then meet and discussed each of their findings and created a combined list of the issues. These issues were ranked again before finally being included into a report to the client.

			<br/>
			<div class="section_head">
				Survey
			</div>
			<div>
				A survey was created in order to learn what a more diverse and general range of users wanted to get out of the experience os using a mobile site, a mortgage site, and their comfort using a mobile device for finances. Using Qualtrics, we created a survey that comprised a serires of demographic and user preference questions and sent it out to people that fit the profile of potential users of the site. Then results were collected and cross tabulations run to find patterns of user preferences.

			<br/>
			<div class="section_head">
				User Testing
			</div>
			<div>
				The final step of our evaluation was a series of user testings. After all of our observations we were able to create a series of tasks that accurately represented the tasks a typical user would perform. A series of six tests were preformed with team members of the team attending, one moderating the session and the other taking notes. Video was also taken and later reviewed to ensure nothing was missed by the initial interpretation of the session. The results were consolidated and several key findings were extracted and given to the client.
